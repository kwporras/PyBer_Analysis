Ultamilty the goal is to improve access to ride-shareing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Toward the end of the project V. Isualize ask that Python and Pandas be used to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
