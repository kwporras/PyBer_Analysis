# PyBer_Analysis

Your first assignment will be to perform an exploratory analysis on data in some very large csv files. To aid this process, you will create several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. You'll write Python scripts using Panda's libraries, the jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib to create a varitey of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, reiders and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations you produce will help PyBer Improve access to ride-shareing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
